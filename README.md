Which factors may be setting the main causality between specific regions of New York City and their prices?

When we look at the Airbnb dataset it can clearly be seen that there are certain pricing gaps when it comes to some regions of NYC as some are plateaued in a higher pricing range whereas some are varied on the lower side depending on their regions. What we are aiming to find are the factors that caused such differentiated plateaus by linking the data obtained from the Airbnb dataset with the datas we believe may cause such gaps in pricing from the dataset retrieved from NYC Open Data.

The datasets we believe may have such impacts on the pricing are:
●	NYC Taxi Zones 
●	Collisions involving vehicles managed by Department of Health and Mental Hygiene 
●	Traffic Volume Counts (2014-2018)
●	Civilian Complaint Review Board - Complaints Received
●	NYC Permitted Event Information
●	Airport Points
●	NYPD Complaint Map (Historic)
●	Subway Entrances
●	Facilities Database - Shapefile
●	Sidewalk Café Regulations GIS: Shapefile
